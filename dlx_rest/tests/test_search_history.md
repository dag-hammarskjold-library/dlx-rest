# Search History Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the test suite for the search history functionality in the DLX REST API. The tests are located in `dlx_rest/tests/test_search_history.py` and cover both the User model methods and the API endpoints.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into two main classes:

1. **`TestSearchHistoryModel`** - Tests the User model search history methods
2. **`TestSearchHistoryAPI`** - Tests the REST API endpoints

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Tests**: 17
- **Model Tests**: 7
- **API Tests**: 10
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all tests pass)

## User Model Tests (`TestSearchHistoryModel`)

### 1. `test_add_search_term_new`
**Purpose**: Verifies that new search terms can be added to a user's search history.

**What it tests**:
- Adding a new search term to an empty or existing history
- Proper increment of history count
- Correct term storage
- Proper datetime assignment

**Expected behavior**:
- History count increases by 1
- New entry contains the correct term
- New entry has a valid datetime object

### 2. `test_add_search_term_duplicate`
**Purpose**: Ensures that duplicate search terms update the timestamp instead of creating duplicate entries.

**What it tests**:

- Timestamp update for existing terms
- No duplicate entries in history

**Expected behavior**:
- Only one entry exists for the term
- Timestamp is updated to current time
- History count remains the same

### 3. `test_get_search_history_ordering`
**Purpose**: Verifies that search history is returned in chronological order (newest first).

**What it tests**:
- Multiple search terms added in sequence

**Expected behavior**:
- History is sorted by datetime descending
- Most recent searches appear first
- All entries maintain chronological order

### 4. `test_delete_search_term`

- Valid JSON payload with term
- Database persistence verification

**Expected behavior**:
- Returns HTTP 200 status
- Response contains term, id, and datetime
- Term is saved to database
- Proper JSON response structure

### 4. `test_post_search_history_duplicate`
**Purpose**: Verifies that duplicate terms are handled correctly via API.

**What it tests**:
- POSTing the same term twice
- Timestamp update behavior
- Response consistency

**Expected behavior**:
- Both requests return HTTP 200
- Same term in both responses
- Different timestamps (updated)
- No duplicate entries in database

### 5. `test_delete_search_history_all`
**Purpose**: Tests clearing all search history via API.

**What it tests**:
- DELETE request to `/api/search-history`
- Complete history clearing
- Database verification

**Expected behavior**:
- Returns HTTP 200 status
- Response contains success message
- Database history is cleared
- User history count becomes 0

### 6. `test_delete_search_history_item_valid`
**Purpose**: Tests deleting specific search history items via API.

**What it tests**:
- DELETE request to `/api/search-history/{id}`
- Specific item removal
- Database verification

**Expected behavior**:
- Returns HTTP 200 status
- Response contains success message
- Specified item is removed from database
- Other items remain unchanged

### 7. `test_search_history_special_characters`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test of special characters, unicode, and emojis.

**What it tests**:
- Various special characters (quotes, brackets, symbols)
- Unicode characters (√©√±√º√ü)

**Expected behavior**:
- Each user sees only their own history
- No cross-contamination between users
- Proper user authentication isolation

## Test Data and Fixtures

### User Fixtures
The tests use predefined user fixtures from `conftest.py`:
- **Admin user**: `test_user@un.org` with admin privileges
- **Non-admin user**: `user@un.org` with basic privileges

### Authentication
Tests use Basic HTTP Authentication with base64-encoded credentials:
```python
credentials = b64encode(bytes(f"{username}:{password}", "utf-8")).decode("utf-8")
```

### Test Data
- **Valid terms**: Normal search queries, special characters, unicode
- **Edge cases**: Empty terms, very long terms, duplicate terms
- **Special content**: Emojis, symbols, mixed character types

python -m pytest dlx_rest/tests/test_search_history.py -v

# Run specific test class
python -m pytest dlx_rest/tests/test_search_history.py::TestSearchHistoryModel -v

```

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Include comprehensive docstrings
3. Test both success and failure cases
4. Verify database state when appropriate
5. Use proper authentication for API tests

### Test Dependencies
- Tests are independent and can run in any order
- Each test cleans up after itself
- No shared state between tests
- Proper fixture usage for setup/teardown

## Conclusion

- **Security**: Proper authentication and user isolation
- **Robustness**: Handles edge cases and special characters
- **Consistency**: Maintains proper data ordering and structure
